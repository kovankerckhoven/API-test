EVENTIGRATE API TEST
1) Retrieve the following data from restful web services:
https://restcountries.eu/ (free, without registration)
    Name
    Calling code
    Capital
    Population
    Currency
    Flag
http://fixer.io/ (free, without registration)
    Exchange rate (EUR vs. AUS, BRA, CHN, GBR, USA)
2) Store the data in a database (SQLite)
3) Report the results for each country (Australia, Brazil, China, Great Britain, USA) back to the end user

The end-user report should contain (the average of) all above properties for the past month in
a nice and clean summary of the following countries: AUS, BRA, CHN, GBR, USA.. The type of
report can be decided completely by you (.xls, .html, .pdf, .txt, .csv, ...). You can choose the
language, technologies, frameworks, tools, etc. Please create your own database and push your
code to a git repository together with an example of the output report and a sketch off your
architecture/design (a photo of a simple paper-sketch suffices) and share the repository with
thomas_demoor@msn.com or the user thomasdemoor on Bitbucket. If something is unclear,
you can always send a mail to thomas@eventigrate.com or give a call at +32497486215.
